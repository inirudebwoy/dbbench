# Overview
Purpose of this project is to benchmark many databases for the same commands.
In order to do that, we will use:

- docker - for quick and simple database managment
- python + pytest - we need to choose one simple benchmark tool. We just choose Python. pytest is very efficent in implementing tests
- CQRS - this approach will help as to make the same result for different databases.
